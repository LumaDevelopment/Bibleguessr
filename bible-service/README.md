# Bible Service

This service manages:

- The storage, retrieval, and reference of Bible passages.
- Managing Bible versions as maps from passage reference to text and retrieving from these versions efficiently without loading all versions into memory.
- Calculation of the proximity between two guesses.
- Generating valid, random Bible passage references and distributing the text of the passage in a specified version.
