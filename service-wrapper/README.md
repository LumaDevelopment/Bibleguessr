# Service Wrapper

A library which standardizes how Bibleguessr services operate. The service wrapper serves as an intermediary between service requests/responses and the library business logic. The intention of the library is to allow for multiple types of service communication: RabbitMQ, GET/POST, and in-code requests. The advantage of this wrapper is the ability to deploy Bibleguessr services in multiple configurations. RabbitMQ can be used when deploying Bibleguessr services in scalable clusters, like with Kubernetes. GET/POST can be used when deploying individual instances of services. In-code requests can be used in resource-constrained environments where all Bibleguessr services are wrapped in one executable to remove the need for containerized services and/or virtualization.

The Service Wrapper should mandate a service ID from services, so that service context paths can be hosted without conflict on bundled deployments (service paths look like `service-id/path`, so that two services can have a path called `path` and no conflicts arise). Additionally, individual service paths should also be registered with the Service Wrapper, likely associated with a custom request object, so that requests can be routed much more efficiently.
