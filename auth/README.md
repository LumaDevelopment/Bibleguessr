- Store salted + hashed passwords in database
- Consider what information should be stored about a user
- Authentication server distributes tokens (maybe OAuth) that expire, contain information about user, etc.
- Authentication tokens are set in browser cookies
- Password is hashed, sent to database, database compares, and then if thereâ€™s a match then return the token.
- Maybe associate token with IP so if token is used from different IP then invalidate it.
- Built-in database encryption, probably MongoDB is best.
