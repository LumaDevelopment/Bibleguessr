- Store salted + hashed passwords in the database
- Consider what information should be stored about a user
- Require the user to make a 12-character password with symbols. Hash with SHA256.
- No password expiration.
- Authentication server distributes tokens (maybe OAuth) that expire, contain information about the user, etc.
- Authentication tokens are set in browser cookies
- Password is hashed, sent to the database, database compares, and then returns the token if thereâ€™s a match.
- Maybe associate the token with IP, so if the token is used from a different IP, then invalidate it.
- Built-in database encryption, probably MongoDB, is best.
-   MongoDB will be used for both account data and account authentication.
